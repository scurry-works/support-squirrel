# Support Squirrel

A Discord support bot example built with [scurrypy](https://github.com/Scurry-Collective/scurrypy).

## Note
This is a **reference implementation** showing how to build a support bot with scurrypy. 
It's configured for a specific server and is meant to be read and learned from, not cloned and run as-is.

## What it demonstrates
* Prefix commands
* Event handling (reactions, member joins)
* Rich embeds with attachments
* Role management
* Channel-specific logic
